IMPORTANT: Ensure you’ve thoroughly reviewed the [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) file before beginning any work.
## ⚠ FIRST: sync this clone before you touch anything

```sh
git pull --rebase --autostash
```

Run this at the **start of every session**, before reading deeply or editing. Several agents and
Christopher push to these repos — including Cosmos agents that run unattended while nobody is at the
machine — so a clone can be behind by the time you open it.

**`--autostash` is what makes this safe on a dirty tree.** It stashes uncommitted changes, rebases
onto the remote, then reapplies them. Your in-progress work survives. Without it, `git pull --rebase`
refuses to run and you are tempted into something worse.

Why it matters more than it sounds:

- A stale clone **does not fail early.** It fails at push time, after the work is done, as a
  non-fast-forward rejection — the most expensive moment to discover it.
- The tempting fix at that point is `git push --force`, which discards whatever someone else pushed
  in the meantime. Syncing first removes the temptation.
- If a rebase does conflict, stop and resolve it deliberately. A conflict is information: someone
  else changed the same lines, and you want to know that *before* building on top of them.

**Fresh clone?** Also run `sh scripts/install-hooks.sh` — git hooks are not version-controlled, so
the commit-attribution hook stays inert until this clone is pointed at `.githooks/`. Details:
[`scripts/README.md`](./scripts/README.md).

## Commit attribution (enforced by hook)

Every commit must carry two git trailers:

```
Co-Authored-By: <Agent> · <Engine> · <Provider> [<Model>]                  # direct
Co-Authored-By: <Agent> · <Engine> · <Gateway> · <Provider> [<Model>]      # proxied
<Platform>-Session: <full session URL>
```

Model in **square brackets**, separator is U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT ( · ). Add `<Gateway>` **only when
inference is proxied** — it names what *routed* the request (`NVIDIA NIM`, `OpenRouter`), never who
made the model (`Z.ai`, `Moonshot AI`, `MiniMaxAI`). The field order mirrors the `/model` selector
string, so `anthropic/nvidia_nim/z-ai/glm4.7` transcribes to `NVIDIA NIM · Z.ai [GLM-4.7]` —
read it left to right rather than memorising it. Local runtimes (`Ollama`, `llama.cpp`,
`LM Studio`) have no gateway: the weights ran on your machine, so the runtime is the Provider. The session
trailer is a **separate** line — folding it onto the `Co-Authored-By:` line breaks git trailer
parsing. Use the full session URL, never a truncated prefix. Key varies by platform:
`Claude-Session:` for Claude Code CLI, `Cosmos-Session:` for Cosmos.

`.githooks/commit-msg` rejects non-conforming commits. **Activate it once per clone:**

```sh
sh scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

Human-only commits: `git commit --no-verify`. **Canonical spec — single source of truth. Do not restate the field table locally; link it:**
